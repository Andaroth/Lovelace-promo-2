# CSS Challenge: Animated BeCode Logo

## The need
BeCode needs a "please wait while loading" animation. They would like to have the same strategy as Android, Slack or Ryver : a visual play on the logo.

## The mission
Design and develop an animation based on the BeCode logo. 

- make it so that it can loop indefinitely.
- make it lightweight (try to keep it below 100ko).
- use only html, svg and css. No javascript.
- make it last a few seconds.

### Examples

- [Android 6 loading animation (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh67AysLALE)
- [Google Loading](https://codepen.io/brycesnyder/pen/GpRYWV)
- [Have a Beer](https://codepen.io/alistairtweedie/pen/GgPBqP)
- [Gravity](https://codepen.io/pnowell/pen/xZpdqR)
